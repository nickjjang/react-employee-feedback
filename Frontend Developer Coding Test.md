# Frontend Developer Coding Test
This code test is one of several offered by Ogilvy to applicants. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: We appreciate when your solution really works, but we will focus our evaluation more on object oriented design, style, separation of concerns, usage of tools, etc.

Try to show us what you're capable of, even if the test could be solved in a more simple way. We're looking at how you think, solve problems, and explain your choices.

*Partial solutions are acceptable.*  It is not necessary to submit a complete solution that implements every requirement.

## REQUIREMENTS
Design a web application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other's performance review.

You MUST include a readme file with instructions for running your application. Be sure to include admin auth creds.


## Admin view
* Admin authentication
* Add/remove/update/view employees
* Add/update/view performance reviews
* Assign employees to participate in another employee's performance review

## Employee view
* List of performance reviews requiring feedback
* Submit feedback

## Scope of this assignment/Helpful hints
* Write a high level description of design and technologies used.
* Document all assumptions made.
* Complete solutions aren't required, but what you submit DOES need to run.
* Implement 2-5 web pages using a modern web framework (React, Angular, or Vue) that talks to a RESTful API (see next bullet for more about the API).
* IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a test of your skills as a frontend developer. We do not expect a fully functioning server side API. Create your API calls in the client side code and create mock responses from the “server.” Because we’re not asking you to implement a full stack solution, your mock API calls do NOT need to generate actual persistent changes. For example, if I remove an employee in the admin view, that employee record doesn’t need to actually be deleted. It will be enough for you to demonstrate how you would make the right calls to make that happen.
* If you have the time and/or want to show off your full stack chops, we absolutely welcome you creating some or all of the server side code too! Most full stack web developers at Ogilvy currently use Node.js, but feel free to use other tech if you prefer.

## How to complete this challenge
* Complete the design and code as defined to the best of your abilities.
* Place notes in your code to help with clarity where appropriate. Make it readable enough to present to the Ogilvy dev team.
* Complete your work in your own GitHub repo and send the results to us OR zip up your code and send it to the person that sent you this test.
* After receiving your code, we'll review it on our own and will schedule a follow-up meeting to review it with you to discuss your solution, ask any clarifying questions, etc.

## What are we looking for?
* Assumptions you make given limited requirements
* Technology and design choices
* Your areas of strength
* This is not a pass or fail test. This will serve as a common ground that we can use to deep dive together into specific issues.

If you have questions, please ask. Thank you, and good luck!
